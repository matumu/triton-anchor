"""
triton-anchor: Unified Triton Compilation Frontend
===================================================

A compilation frontend that converts Triton TTIR to hardware-aware Linalg IR,
serving as the bridge between Triton core and out-of-tree hardware backends.

Architecture:
  Layer 1  — TTIR Pipeline       (core invariant: 7 mandatory passes)
  Layer 2  — Linalg Adapters     (triton-shared / triton-linalg / hybrid)
  Layer 2.5 — AnchorIR Spec      (core invariant: dual-track dialect whitelist)
